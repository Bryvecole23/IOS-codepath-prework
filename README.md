## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Apps/ Favorite features
- Instagram (Dark Mode, Stories/Lives, Explore Page)
- Spotify (Dark Mode, Spotify Wrapped, AI DJ)
- Apple Music (Dark Mode, Sing-Along lyrics, Spatial Audio)
- YouTube (Dark Mode, Watch Later Playlist, Picture-in-picture

An improvement idea for Apple Music is to revamp its interface and music discovery features. While Apple Music offers high-quality audio and exclusive content, it could benefit from a more dynamic and engaging UI that appeals to a broader audience. Enhancing its recommendation algorithm to align more closely with Spotifyâ€™s personalized matching system could significantly improve music discovery, making playlists and song suggestions feel more relevant and tailored to individual tastes. Additionally, expanding social features, like collaborative playlists and improved sharing options, would foster a stronger sense of community among users.

A second idea for improving the YouTube app is to enhance its overall look and feel. During Gen Z's pre-teen and teen years, YouTube thrived with a wide variety of creators and users. However, recently, interest among Gen Z users seems to have declined somewhat. Refreshing the UI with a more vibrant, engaging style could help recapture their attention, making the app more visually appealing and fun to use. Additionally, enhancing the personalized video recommendation algorithm to resemble Spotify's tailored matching system could create a more relevant and engaging content discovery experience for users.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The biggest challenge while buidling the app was getting familiar with Swift and the Xcode IDE.
